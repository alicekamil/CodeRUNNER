# CodeRUNNER

For now, the obstacles position is randomized, the collision doesnt work. This and things listed below is what im striving to fix til next due date:
*Preset floor tiles with obstacles, store them in a tile database, ramp up difficulty as time passes.
*Collectables? 
*Score system and health system
*UI- menu, game over

Extras:
*Coderain-shader for skycube
*Audio
*Animation for changing lane

My game idea:
A female hacker/miner mining crypto by "speedrunning" in a server, solving simple equations displayed in the distance of the level by picking up the right variable. Obstacles could be security "guards" you have to dodge. As per usual, I went overboard with my ideas, since my programming skills are still pretty bad. I will see how far I progress in making this idea reality, as of now I just want to have a playable game.
